# junit-test-generator
Simple JUnit test generator written in Python.

Credit goes to Sean Raven who suggested I use this script instead of writing 1000 JUnit tests.
I simply made the code presentable and added some instructions on how to modify it.
This is particularly useful for anybody currently taking a class in Java.
